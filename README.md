## Trivia Time

Trivia Time is an app designed to play Film or Movie based Trivia.  

After years of watching Films and Tv, I realized that as Movie Fanatic, we have no good way of tracking how much we actually remember.  Trivia Time gives users a way to select question topic and difficulty  to help check thier knowledge on films.
  
Triva Time is for anyone that is looking for a challenge on thier Film knowledge.
